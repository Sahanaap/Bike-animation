# Bike-animation
A bike animation using only HTML and CSS visually shows a moving bike without JavaScript. It uses HTML to create the bike’s structure and CSS animations like @keyframes and transform to rotate wheels and move the bike across the screen, creating a smooth, realistic motion effect purely with styling.
